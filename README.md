# Dragon Warrior 3 Randomizer
## Background
- This is a fork from gameboyf9's Dragon Warrior 3 Randomizer. I have enjoyed Dragon Warrior III since I was a kid, and have enjoyed playing through seeds of the randomizer. While playing and watching other streamers play through seeds, I noticed little bugs here or there, so I figured that I'd take a stab at tackling the issues. It has since grown into splitting out flags, adding features, and looking at other enhancements to the randomizer. This is a project that I initially worked on for myself and chose to share with the community.
- Since the question has been asked to others, this isn't a stab at the product that gameboyf9 put out there. This is just growing the project and honoring the work that he had put forth on the randomizer.
